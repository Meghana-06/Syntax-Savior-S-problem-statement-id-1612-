Scheduling Algorithms*:
   - At the core of an ABSRMS are sophisticated scheduling algorithms that determine the optimal allocation of buses to various routes. These algorithms consider factors such as traffic conditions, passenger demand, and vehicle availability to create efficient schedules that minimize wait times and maximize service frequency.
